# Random Video Clip Generator - Docker
Plays random sections of videos for background visual noise. Great for parties. You only need to install Docker! 

You will need:
* Docker Desktop (available for Windows and Linux).
* The videos have to be previously downloaded locally.

### How to use: ###
1. Install Docker Desktop: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/ 
2. Create a directory under your C drive called share and download a couple of music videos there. For obvious reasons I cannot tell you how to download YouTube videos here. For instructions please contact me: juancmarquina@gmail.com 
3. Start Docker Desktop. 
4. %%% GUI %%% Get Docker Image and run it:
5. Open your web browser (like FireFox or Brave) and go to http://localhost:8000
6. IF you don't see your video clips playing, please contact me.
7. To make new videos available to the container simply move them into share directory in your host OS (e.g. Windows), no need to restart the container.
